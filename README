has been in production use for quite some time.


# intro

scgid is a daemon.  it listens for tcp connections (usually from a
webserver), and handles scgi requests by calling a program and returning
its output.


# install & run

to compile, make sure there is a mkconfig in this directory.  you bind
or symlink the mkconfig from your inferno install into this directory.
next "mk" and possibly "mk install".

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

see the manual page for usage information.
